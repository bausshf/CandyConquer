Candy
###################
Candy is a very wide implementation of ORM.
It's not using any existing ORM utilities and is completely written from scratch.
The aim for candy is to provide a stable, fast and reliable ORM for any kind of data.
Which means Candy can be used to read, write and update any kind of data to any kind of storage.
Candy is not necessarily meant to be used for databases and with its abstraction can be used for anything,
such as file structures, memory mappings etc.
It caches values and properties to ensure a fast mapping from data to object or object to data.
The whole mapping is done with "cached" reflection, keeping it fast and dynamic.
For more information or examples please view the CandyTest project or any of the sample projects.

Currently official implementations:
CandySql - An implementation of Candy to Microsoft's Sql Server
CandyMySql - An implementation of Candy to MySql (Coming soon, the design will be similar to CandySql.)
