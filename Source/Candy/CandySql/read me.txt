Why CandySql over the standard Sql implementation?
CandySql builds upon the standard sql implementation, but utilizes in the Candy ORM.

* Similar to EntityFramework, so if you're familiar with that; using Candy is not an issue.
* A really flexible API.
* Implementation can be customized to fit any need.
* Types and values are cached, to give best performance.
* Specialized type- and property attributes. (Such as id properties or timestamp properties.)
* Compatible with any other ORM using Candy.
* Customizable to the core.
* Helper functions and extensions to utilize Candy even more, creating a really flexible sql API.
* Fast implementation, does not require many lines of code to implement.
* Query based, you write your queries, instead of relying on Linq to Sql, which gives you complete control over the generated sql query.
* Custom read properties allowing you to decide how data is read, as well how type-conversions are handled.
