Candy Conquer is a Conquer Online Private Server Source written in C#.

It's the base project for ProjectX V5.

To build the project you should right click on either world api or auth api and then build or run them.

Do not attempt to build all projects as the script projects will fail to compile.

Stripped features:
	Tournament point system
	Nobility game modes (Only traditional nobility is introduced in this version.)
	Arena game modes (Only traditional arena is introduced in this version.)
	Some security features.
	
Slightly not tested features:
	Arena (It works, but has not been tested to the fulliest.)
		Note: Arena watching is not currently working due to matches not showing in the client and I won't be fixing it in this version,
		so wait for it to be fixed later or do it yourself.
